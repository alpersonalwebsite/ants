## September 25, 2021

I started using the `air filter`.

## September 24, 2021

I connected a secondary test tube to the `Acromyrmex Versicolor` tube and added flower's mix, nectar and shrimp.
I did this because the fungus seemed to be decreasing. 

## September 20, 2021

Both `Queens`, `Myrmecocystus Mimicus` and `Camponotus Lateralis` end moving between 12 pm PT and 1.30 pm PT.

## September 19, 2021

<!-- 
Camponotus Laevigatus Queen died
Liometopum Occidentale  Queen died

I started the test moving at 2.50 pm PT of the following colonies:

1. Veromessor Andrei - Moved before 9pm PT
2. Novomessor Cockerelli - Moved before 5pm PT
3. Camponotus Lateralis 
4. Novomessor Cockerelli (Queen) - Moved before 3pm PT
5. Myrmecocystus Mimicus (this is one of the new colonies. The test tube was broken)

Also, I made 6 new nests.

## September 1, 2021

New colonies arrived:
1. Myrmecocystus Novajo
2. Myrmecocystus Mexicanus
3. Myrmecocystus Mexicanus

The issue with the condensation seems fixed. I also addded big bax of `Silica Gel Desiccant`.

## August 29, 2021

Added sand to the `Myrmecocystus Mimicus` test tube.
The condensation issue is getting better.

## August 29, 2021

Both "formicariums" (`Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` and `Camponotus Pennsylvanicus`) are still having condensation issues. **However**, they look better after the holes. As I did the last days, I dried teh water on the walls.

## August 28, 2021

Both "formicariums" (`Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` and `Camponotus Pennsylvanicus`) are still having condensation issues.
I made 3 holes on each lid and cover them with the `100 micron screen stainless`.
I received today the `Silica Gel Desiccant` bags. I will be placing some of them around the nest and tubes to absorb excess of moisture.

## August 27, 2021

I raised the temperature of the top mat to `85F`. It was in 77F as the other one but it felt too low when I touched it.

## August 26, 2021

Both "formicariums" (`Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` and `Camponotus Pennsylvanicus`) are still having condensation issues; however, I think it is getting better. I'm still cleaning daily the extra water on the walls. 

## August 25, 2021

Both new "formicariums" are having the issue of water condensed on the walls.
I removed the cotton from the `Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` nest. They were making a mess.
Today I added some blue sponges and dried the walls.

## August 24, 2021

The `Camponotus Sansabeanus` moved during the night.

I added 2 balls of cotton to the `Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` colony to try to reduce humidity. I will check later and keep watching it.
They found a space between one of the test tubes and the ground and they are putting the eggs and larvae there.

I started the moving at 4.10 pm PT of the `Camponotus Pennsylvanicus` from the formicarium to the test tube. The moved before 5pm PT.

## August 23, 2021

The `Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` colony seems fine. 
For the next time, I should add less water.
I will keep an eye on this and if the high humidity persists, I will replace the test tube with one with less water and add some strips of blotting paper.
Also, I should replace the fluon which was washed. 

I started the test moving at 3.10 pm PT of the following colonies.
This time, since I did not see initial movement and the they was cloudy, I added some light.

1. Camponotus Sansabeanus
  Update 5.15 pm PT: They don't seem to be interested at all in the new nest
2. Camponotus Vicinus (high) - Moved before 5pm PT
3. Myrmecocystus mimicus - I forced the Queen (the only ant in this colony) to move around 5.15pm PT

### August 22, 2021

Today I made 3 nests.
I followed the same recipe as yesterday but I poured just half. 
They weight less and I think they are going to do better. The only complaint, I couldn't remove the test tubes as yesterday. Today, I have to broke them. Something to improve in the future.

I placed the test tube of the `Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus` colony in one of the new formicariums.
I added a new test tube with half of water.
They were struggling and without water in the old test tube. They started to eat the eva rubber that was separating the water chamber (empty) in search of water.
I also added 2 crickets and a little tower with nectar.
I put a temporary roof.

### August 21, 2021

Today I made 2 nests using the acrylic containers and hydrostone.
The proportion used was: 1 water x 3 hydrostone. 
I prepared it in a plastic jug, mixing it for 2 minutes. I used warm water.
After pouring the blend, I waited a couple of minutes and put down 2 empty test tubes (20 x 150); minutes later, I added the sand (when it still was not too dry). I have to remove the extra sand.

Tomorrow, I will try to do the same but, pouring half of what I put in to reduce weight.
Also, I will press the test tubes (maybe until I reach the bottom) so the ants could have more shadiness. 


### August 19, 2021

New colonies arrived:
1. Liometopum Occidentale
2. Myrmecocystus Mimicus
3. Myrmecocystus Novajo
4. Pogonomyrmex Subnitidus

### August 16, 2021

I found the 2 remaining `Pogonomyrmex Californicus` Queen dead (👑☠️)
It seems they overheated. 

I added water and humidity to `Camponotus Pennsylvanicus`.

### August 11, 2021

Since the colonies were not moving to the new tubes, I exposed them to the later afternoon sun (around 4pm) and covered the new test tubes.
The `Camponotus US-CA02` moved in less than 30 mins.
The `Camponotus Laevigatus` moved in less than 2 hours.

### August 10, 2021

I plugged new test tubes to the `Camponotus Laevigatus` and `Camponotus US-CA02` ones, securing them with tape.
Part of the new tubes are on the heating mats.

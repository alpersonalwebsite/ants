Do Myrmecocystus species need no heater during winter?
I have read some articles where recommend to avoid heating during winter.
I have the followings:
- Myrmecocystus Depilis
- Myrmecocystus Kennedyi 
- Myrmecocystus Mexicanus
- Myrmecocystus Melliger
- Myrmecocystus Mimicus 
- Myrmecocystus Navajo
- Myrmecocystus Placodops
- Myrmecocystus Yuma 

Do Pheidole species need to have a diapause? If so, from which month to which month?
I have the followings:
- Pheidole Bicarinata
- Pheidole Californica
- Pheidole Gilvescens

Diapuase for Odontomachus Clarus and from which month to which month?

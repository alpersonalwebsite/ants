# Dead Ants Preservation

I did my first preservations on **November 10, 2022**

I followed the `wet preservation` method consigned here: https://xtraordinarypets.com/how-to-preserve-dead-insect-pets/

These are the steps:

1. Place the ant/ants in boiling water for ~ 10 seconds
1. Place the ant/ants in 30% ethanol for 1 day.
1. Place the ant/ants in 50% ethanol for 1 day.
1. Place the ant/ants in 75% ethanol for 1 day.


I used the "chinese small plastic cups" for all the previous step (for putting boiler water and add the ants, for keeping the ants in alcohol every day).
I use two, one as cup and the other to cover it taping the joints with masking tape.

For the following examples, I use `isopropyl rubbing alcohol 70%` and `isopropyl rubbing alcohol 91%` (both can be easily found in pharmacies, supermarkets and stores.
For the water: **distilled water**.

**This is the formula used for the dilution.**

```
(alcohol_%_we_want_to_obtain * amount_of_water_we_want_to_use) / alcohol_%
```

Examples:

* To obtain `30% alcohol` from a concentrate of `70% alcohol` with `350 ml of distilled water`: (30% * 350ml) / 70% = `150 of 70% alcohol`
* To obtain `50% alcohol` from a concentrate of `70% alcohol` with `250 ml of distilled water`: (50% * 250ml) / 70% = `178.5ml of 70% alcohol`
* To obtain `75% alcohol` from a concentrate of `91% alcohol` with `250 ml of distilled water`: (75% * 250ml) / 91% = `206ml of 91% alcohol`
